## Journal review and editing
I'm proud to be a member of the editorial board at [JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org")!

I also serve as a peer reviewer for a variety of journals, including Physical Review Materials, the Journal of Photovoltaics, and Nature Computational Science.

## Other Service
I have long been an advocate for women and other underrepresented groups in STEM. I have participated in and helped organize several [CUWiP](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/cuwip/) conferences. I was co-president of MIT's [Womxn of Materials Science](http://woms.scripts.mit.edu/website/) group, as well as a member of the [Graduate Student Advisory Group for Engineering](https://engineering.mit.edu/about/leadership/graduate-student-advisory-group/) at MIT, where I served on the advisor-advisee relations subcommittee advocating for measures to mitigate problematic power dynamics in advising relationships.

I've also worked on solar PV-related advocacy work, including serving as a community lead for the [MIT Energy Club](https://www.mitenergyclub.org) and a leader of [Project Bright](https://campuspress.yale.edu/projectbright/) at Yale.
