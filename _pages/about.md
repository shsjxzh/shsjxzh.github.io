Welcome to my website!

I'm a computational materials scientist (with significant previous experimental experience), currently a Molecular Sciences Software Institute Postdoctoral Fellow working in the group of [Venkat Viswanathan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html) on discovery of battery and catalyst materials. 

Previously, I did my PhD in the [Photovoltaics Research Lab](http://pv.mit.edu) at MIT, where I performed first-principles simulations to understand defect physics in solar cell materials as well as high-throughput device-level simulations to use Bayesian inference along with experimental data to more quickly and accurately measure fundamental materials properties. Prior to that, I received my MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy from the University of Cambridge, supported by a Gates Cambridge Scholarship.

My overarching goal in my work is to have an impact on the existential problem of climate change through improving renewable energy technology. I've also been involved in renewables-related outreach through [Project Bright](http://campuspress.yale.edu/projectbright/) at Yale as well as various organizations at MIT including my former research group, the [MIT Energy Club](https://www.mitenergyclub.org) (where I led the Solar/Grid community for two years), the Office of Sustainability, Fossil Free MIT, and the [Science Policy Initiative](mit science policy initative).

Since my time as an undergrad in physics at Yale, I've also been devoted to the cause of increasing representation of women (and other URG's) in STEM fields. In 2012, I helped to organize the Northeast [Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm), and I returned to the conference as a graduate student speaker 2015. At MIT, I served as co-president of Women of Materials Science (WoMS).

About this site
===============

This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
