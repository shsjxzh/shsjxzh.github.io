<!-- 
My name is Zihao Xu. I am a second-year doctoral candidate in the CS program of Rutgers University. My advisor is  Prof. Hao Wang. My research interest lies in Bayesian Deep Learning and Domain Adaptation. 
I completed my undergraduate studies at Shanghai Jiaotong University (top 5 university in China), majoring in computer science. I am also a member of ACM Honors Class (An honor program for top 5% students in Computer Science of Shanghai Jiaotong University. Famous alumni include Tianqi Chen (assistant professor of CMU), Mu Li (Sr. Principal Scientist of Amazon) and Bo Li (assistant professor of Harvard Medical School)). -->

I am Zihao Xu (徐 子昊), a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science program at Rutgers University. My advisor is Professor [Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/), and my research focuses on **Bayesian Deep Learning and Domain Adaptation**.
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiaotong University, a top-ranked university in China. During my time there, I was also a member of the ACM Honors Class, a prestigious program for the top 5% of Computer Science students at the university. Notable alumni of the program include [Tianqi Chen](https://tqchen.com/) (Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University), [Mu Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mulicmu/) (Senior Principal Scientist at Amazon), and [Bo Li](https://lilab-bcb.github.io/) (Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School).

## What do/did I do?

**As of September 1, 2022, I will be an Assistant Research Professor in Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon!** Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in working together, either collaboratively or as a mentee.

I'm a computational materials scientist (with significant previous experimental experience), until recently a Molecular Sciences Software Institute Postdoctoral Fellow working in the group of [Venkat Viswanathan](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/venkatv/index.html) on discovery of battery and catalyst materials, with affiliations in the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. I am the lead developer of the [Chemellia](https://github.com/Chemellia) "machine learning with atoms" ecosystem, in particular the [ChemistryFeaturization](https://chemellia.github.io/ChemistryFeaturization.jl/stable/) and [AtomicGraphNets](https://github.com/Chemellia/AtomicGraphNets.jl) packages.

Previously, I did my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering in the [Photovoltaics Research Lab](http://pv.mit.edu) at MIT, where I performed first-principles simulations to understand defect physics in solar cell materials (in close collaboration with [Vladan Stevanovic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=itfRzZAAAAAJ&hl=en) of the Colorado School of Mines and National Renewable Energy Lab) as well as high-throughput device-level simulations to use Bayesian inference along with experimental data to more quickly and accurately measure fundamental materials properties. Prior to that, I received my MPhil in Materials Science and Metallurgy from the University of Cambridge, supported by a Gates Cambridge Scholarship.

## What do I care about?
My overarching goal in my work is to have an impact on the existential problem of climate change through improving renewable energy technology. I've also been involved in renewables-related outreach through [Project Bright](http://campuspress.yale.edu/projectbright/) at Yale as well as various organizations at MIT including the PVLab, the [MIT Energy Club](https://www.mitenergyclub.org) (where I led the Solar/Grid community for two years), the Office of Sustainability, Fossil Free MIT, and the [Science Policy Initiative](https://mitspi.squarespace.com).

Since my time as an undergrad in physics at Yale, I've also been devoted to the cause of increasing representation of women (and other URG's) in STEM fields. In 2012, I helped to organize the Northeast [Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm), and I returned to the conference as a graduate student speaker 2015. At MIT, I served as co-president of Women of Materials Science (WoMS).
