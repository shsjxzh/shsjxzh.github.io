Work-related
------------
* My partner [Jerry](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/m5lab/) and I were interviewed on [The Two Body Problem Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-two-body-problem-podcast/id1546810474), hosted by our good friends Sarah and Akshay

* I appeared on a [Julia Beginner AMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLdlIs_e07E) with [Dr. Katie Hyatt](https://kshyatt.github.io) of the Flatiron Institute

* [MIT Press](http://news.mit.edu/2017/new-technique-allows-rapid-screening-new-types-solar-cells-1220) coverage of my first Bayesian parameter estimation paper, this press release got picked up a bunch of other places including [EurekAlert](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-12/miot-nta122017.php), [GE's Five Coolest Things on Earth this Week](https://www.ge.com/reports/5-coolest-things-earth-week-41/), [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/12/171220131641.htm), [Tech Explorist](https://www.techexplorist.com/new-technique-allows-rapid-screening-for-new-types-of-solar-cells/9824/), and [Power Electronics](https://www.powerelectronics.com/power-management/unique-test-and-model-method-quickly-screens-new-photovoltaic-materials).

* Another paper I coauthored [also made it](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170718113713.htm) into Science Daily.

Not Work
--------
* My wonderful friend Sarah [featured me on her vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8lfNXKWiME) where we discuss mental health in grad school. Serious business, but we had a fun time.

* I discovered that I'm acknowledged by legendary Yale mathematician (and collaborator of the late Benoit Mandelbrot) Michael Frame in his book [_Fractal Worlds: Grown, Built, and Imagined_](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300197877/fractal-worlds) (coauthored with Amelia Urry). I took his Fractal Geometry class as a sophomore and fondly remember everything about it, including great conversations during his office hours, so I couldn't be more honored about this!

* [MIT Press](http://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-students-and-postdocs-advocate-for-science-engineering-funding-on-capitol-hill-0511) coverage of MIT Science Policy Initiative's 2017 Congressional Visit Days feat. a few pictures of business-casual me

* [Yale Daily News](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/02/13/two-yalies-named-gates-scholars/) coverage of Gates Cambridge scholarship

Fairly Goofy
------------
* Being a crossword fangirl [got me into the Yale Daily News once](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2010/04/13/shortz-puzzles-cruciverbalists/).

* Also, I was apparently Yale's [rogue knitter](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2010/09/10/knitters-find-a-place-in-yales-social-fabric/).

Really Old
----------

* Coverage of my Intel (now Regeneron) Science Talent Search semifinalist status [on University of Rochester's page](https://www.rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3305)

* [I'm good at taking tests and people are way too excited about it](https://www.mpnnow.com/x1191421564/Harley-student-aces-national-exam)
