I served as a teaching assistant to the first-year graduate course 3.23: *Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials*, taught by Prof. Geoffrey Beach. Responsibilities included writing problem sets and solutions, giving recitation lectures, and holding office hours and exam review sessions.

I also baked thematic treats for the students on exam days, with the crowning glory being h(oney)-bars for the final exam!
