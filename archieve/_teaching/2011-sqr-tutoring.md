I served as a Science and QR (quantitative reasoning) tutor through the Yale Dean's office. Students who were struggling in their classes could apply for a tutor and I would meet with them one-on-one and help them learn material and work on their homework. I tutored for a variety of classes including calculus and introductory physics.
